1. Introduction
This documentation presents a detailed explanation of a Java calculator program built using the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and provides functionalities like clearing the input and displaying the previous result.

2. Code Overview
The calculator code comprises two main classes:

MyFrame: This class extends Frame and implements ActionListener and WindowListener. It serves as the primary frame for the calculator GUI.
calculator: The calculator class contains the main method responsible for creating an instance of MyFrame and displaying the calculator interface.

3. GUI Components
The GUI of the calculator includes the following components:

Text Field (TextField): Used for input and output display.
Buttons (Button):
Numeric Buttons (0-9): Allow users to input numbers.
Arithmetic Buttons (+, -, *, /): Used for basic arithmetic operations.
Special Buttons (% - modulus, ** - exponentiation, clr - clear input, Ans - display previous result, (-) - negation).

4. Event Handling
Action Handling (ActionListener): Implemented to handle button clicks and perform corresponding actions based on user input.
Window Handling (WindowListener): Used for managing window events such as closing the calculator.

5. Usage and Functionality
Users can input numbers and perform arithmetic operations by clicking the respective buttons on the calculator interface.
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and special operations (modulus, exponentiation, negation, clearing input).
The "Ans" button allows users to perform repeated calculations based on the previous result, enhancing usability.
The calculator provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for performing mathematical calculations efficiently.

6. Error Handling
Division by Zero: The calculator handles division by zero by displaying an "error" message when attempting to divide by zero, ensuring error-free operation.

7. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Java calculator program offers a versatile and functional tool for performing arithmetic calculations. Its intuitive interface, coupled with error handling and additional functionalities, makes it suitable for various mathematical tasks in a user-friendly manner.
